This guide explains how to install the Zepmeds web application onto your phone's home screen, making it work just like a native app. This is possible because the app is a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## For Android Users (Using Google Chrome)

Modern Android browsers make it very easy to install PWAs.

1.  **Open the Website:** Launch the Google Chrome app on your Android device and navigate to the Zepmeds website URL.

2.  **Look for the Install Prompt:**
    *   After you visit the site a couple of times, Chrome will often automatically show a pop-up banner at the bottom of the screen that says **"Add Zepmeds to Home Screen"**.
    *   Simply tap this banner.

3.  **Manual Installation (If the prompt doesn't appear):**
    *   Tap the **three-dot menu icon** in the top-right corner of Chrome.
    *   A menu will appear. Look for the **"Install app"** or **"Add to Home screen"** option and tap it.

4.  **Confirm Installation:** A confirmation box will appear, showing the app's icon and name. Tap **"Install"** or **"Add"**.

5.  **Done!** The Zepmeds app icon will now appear on your phone's home screen and in your app drawer, just like any other app you've downloaded from the Play Store. You can launch it directly from there.

## For iOS Users (iPhone/iPad using Safari)

The process on iOS is also simple but is done manually through the Safari browser's share menu.

1.  **Open the Website:** Launch the Safari app on your iPhone or iPad and navigate to the Zepmeds website URL.

2.  **Tap the Share Icon:** Tap the **Share button**. This is the icon at the bottom of the screen that looks like a square with an arrow pointing upwards.

3.  **Find "Add to Home Screen":** A share sheet will slide up from the bottom. Scroll down through the list of options until you find **"Add to Home Screen"**. Tap on it.

4.  **Confirm the Name:** You'll be shown a screen where you can confirm the name of the app as it will appear on your home screen. It should already say "Zepmeds". Tap the **"Add"** button in the top-right corner.

5.  **Done!** The Zepmeds app icon will now appear on your home screen. You can launch it from there, and it will open in its own dedicated window without the Safari browser interface.
